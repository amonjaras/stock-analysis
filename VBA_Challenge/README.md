# Report VBA Stock Analysis Challenge
## Overview of the Project

#### Step 1a: Create a *tickerIndex* variable equal to zero in order to get the correct index within the four different arrays.

'tickerIndex = 0'

#### Step 1b: Create three output arrays to hold an arbitrary number of variables of the same type.

'''
Dim tickerVolumes(12) As Long
Dim tickerStartingPrices(12) As Single
Dim tickerEndingPrices(12) As Single
'''

#### Step 2a: Create a loop to initialize the *tickerVolumes* to zero.

'''
For i = 0 To 11
        tickerVolumes(i) = 0
    Next i
'''

#### Step 2b: Create a second loop that can be executed over all raws in a spreadsheet.


#### Step 3a: Inside *Step 2b* we create an script to increase *tickerVolumes* to the current stock, using *tickerIndex* as the index itself
